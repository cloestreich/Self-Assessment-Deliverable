# Self-Assessment-Deliverable

### Self-Assessment

My role in the group was to be in charge of the github repository.  I also tasked with making visualization graphs over the project to scale the temperature and humidity of Copenhagen, and population of the insects in question.  Our discussions between the three of us were very productive in getting to our final goal.  The greatest challenge of the project was being able to make succinct and accurate graphs.

### Team Assessment

The biggest challenge of the team was figuring out the merging of Samantha's fourth branch.  It made a lot of the files disappear from the main branch, but we were able to figure it out.  Samantha and Andrea were very knowledgeable in their sections: Samantha with the presentation and google slides and Andrea with the machine learning.

### Summary of Project

The purpose of this project is to chart the population of insects over a certain period compared to temperatures.  Weâ€™re looking to see if the temperatures from 1992 to 2009 have an impact on the insect population and if global warming plays a part.  We were able to conclude that the increasing temperatures in Denmark did not have an impact on the insects going to the light traps.  Overall, neither the data visualizations nor the machine learning were able to show a long term effect of the temperatures on the insect population that was being observed.
